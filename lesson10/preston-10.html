            <h4>Strikingly Short Hair Styles</h4>
            <p>Some men look far better in very short haircuts. Though a big number of boys make spikes or have medium short hair but some very short hair styles have an edge over the other styles. It is worth to mention here Wentworth Miller from Prison Break who stole the hearts of many with his buzz cut. Russell Crowe looks perfect in his short Caesar cut which he appeared with in Gladiator.</p>
            <h4>Seeking the Advice of a Barber</h4>

            <h4>Popular Short Haircuts</h4>
            <p>There are countless short haircuts as the bigger number of men prefers shorthair for their easy upkeep and simple care. To maintain diversity in men’s hair style, different types of short haircuts are introduced in the style and fashion industry. Crew cut is among some top popular haircuts for men.

            <h4>Choosing a Haircut</h4>
            <p>The choice of haircut is wide and broad. The most important thing about picking a suitable hair cut is not only one that suits your face and personality but a style that adds in your confidence and makes you feel great is the best style for you. If you feel down or get upset from your image in the mirror that it is high time that you change your hair style. Another amazing tip to improve your hairstyle is to dye your hair. With a different dye you can choose a hair style that is completely different. Some styles may look great on your face and enhance your looks greatly only if you dye your hair differently. To bring a bigger and over all change in your appearance, keep your hair style at its best from all points.</p>
